# Deep Learning for Lung Disease Detection

This undergraduate thesis project involves using deep learning techniques to detect lung diseases from X-ray images. The project focuses on the impact of different hyperparameters and transfer learning methods on the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection. By training various deep learning models on a dataset of lung X-rays, we aim to identify optimal configurations for accurately diagnosing conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. The study also explores how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for this specific medical application, potentially improving performance and reducing training time. This project demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing diagnostic processes in healthcare.
